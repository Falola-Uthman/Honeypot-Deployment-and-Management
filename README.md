# Honeypot Deployment and Management


## Objective

The project was an in-depth investigation into cybersecurity defense mechanisms, specifically in the deployment and management of honeypots. The principal aim was to design and implement a honeypot network to attract and analyze malicious traffic. This task involved configuring virtual machines, setting up a firewall, and monitoring traffic using various tools, leading to a comprehensive understanding of threat landscapes and attacker behaviors.

## Skills Learned

- Cloud Infrastructure Deployment: Utilized Vultr cloud services to deploy a honeypot without the need for local virtual machines.
- Intrusion Detection: Monitored and analyzed unauthorized access attempts to understand attacker tactics and system vulnerabilities.
- Security Policy Configuration: Implemented firewall rules in Vultr to manage and control access to the honeypot environment.
- Data Visualization and Analysis: Used tools like Kibana for sophisticated data visualization and Attack Map for real-time attack tracking.
-Threat Intelligence: Correlated attack data to generate actionable threat intelligence for security strategy improvement.

## Tools Used

- Vultr: Chosen for its cloud infrastructure to host the honeypot environment, leveraging its scalability and ease of use.
- T-Pot: Integrated to provide diverse honeypot capabilities and attract various types of cyber threats.
- Attack Map: Used for dynamic visualization of cyber attacks, highlighting their origins and methods.
- Kibana: Deployed for in-depth data analysis and visualization, facilitating detailed insights into the nature of the threats.
- Firewall: Configured within Vultr to provide robust network traffic control and to safeguard the integrity of the honeypot system.

## Steps

- Utilized Vultr to create a cloud-based honeypot, leveraging its global infrastructure to attract a wide range of cyber threats.
- Configured a diverse set of honeypots using T-Pot to simulate multiple services and vulnerabilities.
- Implemented and managed firewall rules to ensure the honeypot was exposed to potential attackers while preventing unauthorized access to other services.
- Monitored real-time attacks using Attack Map to visualize threats as they occurred across the globe.
- Analyzed attack patterns, origins, and behaviors with Kibana, synthesizing the data into comprehensive threat intelligence reports.
